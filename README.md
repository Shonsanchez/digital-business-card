# Digital Business Card

This repository holds my first react application - a digital business card. The links send users to the base websites instead of my personal profiles.
I will update the links in my future iterations to hold my profile links.

Quick start:

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:
